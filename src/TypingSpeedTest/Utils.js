export const PARAGRAPH = "Global warming is the long-term rise in Earth’s average temperature caused mainly by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial emissions. These actions increase greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane, trapping heat in the atmosphere. The effects include melting ice caps, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and loss of biodiversity. Global warming also threatens food security, public health, and economies worldwide. To combat it, nations must transition to renewable energy, protect forests, and adopt sustainable practices. Urgent global cooperation is vital to limit temperature rise and ensure a stable, livable planet for future generations."
